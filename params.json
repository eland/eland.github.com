I've been doing contract work ever since for a local company, and I am in the market for a job that challenges me, recognizes that there's more to life than coding (even though coding is nifty) and a balance is to be had, and hopefully that wants to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\n### Portfolio (with screenshots)\r\nComing soon.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
