I've spent the past week or two renewing my passions and digging down deep to understand what motivates me. Especially while on the job market, it's tempting to get better at programming in order to impress someone else and meet their standards. Impressing and meeting standards are good things, yet as a source of motivation they are terrible. Which standards? For whom? In what timeframe? With what corners cut? Others' views as motivation is nebulous, fickle, and unsatisfying.

What motivates me? What sustains my passion? Sheer love of what I do is a part of it. The other part is to compare myself with myself -- to try and become the best developer I can, utilizing and improving my skills. I've found my heart isn't in to competition so much as it is into excellence. 

As such, I'm taking some time to brush up on the fundamentals of Ruby and JavaScript again, and then focusing on Rails and Angular or Backbone, as well as RSpec and Mocha.

Over the past several months I've worked with Vagrant, Chef, Rails 3, Rails 4, Python with Flask, Backbone, Chaplin, and a little bit of Struts 2. Time to focus more, and dive deeper.

I appreciate persistence, hard work, and a sustainable pace. I'm in this for the long haul. Knowing my motivations gets me a step closer.
