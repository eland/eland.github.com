        What is an eland? It's a species of antelope. Now that the burning question of your lives is out of the way, we can move on to what you really came here for.

      I'm a ruby developer (mainly Rails, both 3 and 4, sometimes on JRuby) that has also done some JavaScript MVC work with ChaplinJS. I graduated from the Portland Code School late last year and have been doing contract work at a local company ever since. I'm looking for my next step: a company that has challenging work, a collaborative atmosphere, and big bonus points if it's trying to make the world a better place!

      I try to stay balanced. I play instruments such as a simple-system flute and erhu; generally go and be social; code on the side here and there; and sometimes think about life rather deeply.

      Unfortunately, most of my contributions of the past several months are in private repositories. I'm working on showcasing what I can do with the determined-mountain-goat project, and the clojure-luminus project shows some things I'm curious about. Everything else is either from the teaching phase of the Code School or before it. If you want to know if I can do X, send me a project to code! I enjoy challenges like that.
